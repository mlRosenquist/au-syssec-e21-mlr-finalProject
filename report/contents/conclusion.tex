A preliminary security analysis was performed on GulOgGratis' Android application. The analysis was conducted on the basis of a constructed threat model. It was broken down to four different aspects and it was shown that there are flaws more severe then others. Simple mechanisms should be implemented to harden adversaries achieving insight in their application. Improvements can be made in regards of network traffic, authentication methods and privacy transparency. The application is not vulnerable to any apparent and simple to pull of exploits. However, an adversary with a strong motivation might be able to mount an attack. Either by performing a man-in-the-middle attack or stealing the user's token. This would result in a complete violation of almost all security properties.
